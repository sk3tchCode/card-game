# card-game
Important: This Card Game was programmed alongside two other people aside from myself, Zaina and Ivy.

To run the program go to CodeHS sandbox and create a new project in Java (main). Copy and paste the code from the CardGame.txt file, the Player.txt file and the Card.txt file into seperate files. The CardGame.txt is the main class.
